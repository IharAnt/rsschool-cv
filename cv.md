### About myself:
I like to invent, design, and create useful things or programs. I like computer games and I am crazy about computers and programming. I started my IT career as a tech support specialist. At first, I solved the players' technical problems. After a couple of months, I started developing [tools](https://ru.wargaming.net/support/ru/products/wot/article/15170/) that can help my colleagues solve players' technical problems more quickly. 
Now I am a software engineer. I am involved in the development of internal programs and I continue to develop the [WGCheck](https://ru.wargaming.net/support/ru/products/wot/article/15170/) tools.
